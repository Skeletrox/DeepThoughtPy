## Inspiration

> *"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But, I'll have to think about it."*

> *Fook glanced impatiently at his watch. “How long?” he said.*

> *“Seven and a half million years,” said Deep Thought.*

> *“Seven and a half million years...!” they cried in chorus.*

> *“Yes,” declaimed Deep Thought, “I said I’d have to think about it, didn’t I?"*

[Seven and a half million years later.... Fook and Lunkwill are long gone, but their descendents continue what they started]

> *"All right," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question..."*

> *"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought.*

> *"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused.*

> *"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.*
